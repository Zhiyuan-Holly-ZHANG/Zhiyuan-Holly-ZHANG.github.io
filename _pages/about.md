I am currently a computer science undergrad in [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). My research interest includes privacy and security in LLM, interpretable AI, and their applications.

I am very honored to be advised by [Prof. Lin](https://wanyu-lin.github.io/) for my final year project.
